  interface partners using a loosely coupled message-based communication. The success of a use case is defined by 
  the cooperation of several applications exchanging information with each other. Therefore it is essential to test 
  this cooperation/communication between the applications in several integration tests.</p><p>In software devlopment integration testing aims to test the interaction of software components that 
  depend on each other. In EAI projects these components are loosely coupled sofware systems communicating with each other
  over various transports exchanging messages and information. The interaction of these components is essential to 
  successfully process a use case scenario.</p><p>How can somebody test use case scenarios that include several interface partners interacting with each other? How can 
  somebody ensure that the software component he/she is in charge of is working correctly with the other software systems.
  How can somebody run positive and negative integration test cases in an automated reproducable way? 
  Citrus tries to answer these questions by offering fully automated integration testing always looking at the whole picture of several
  systems interacting with each other.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="introduction-overview"></a>1.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Citrus aims to strongly support you in simulating your interface partners. You can easily subscribe and publish 
    to a wide range of protocols like HTTP, JMS, TCP/IP and SOAP in order to test your message based applications. 
    The framework will send/receive messages in order to create a communication as it would be in real production environment. 
    In each step the framework is able to validate the message contents by comparing them to expected contents. In addition to that 
    the framework offers a wide range of functionalities to take control of the process flow during a test (e.g. iterations, 
    system availability checks, database validation, parallelism, delaying, error simulation, and many more).</p><p>The basic goal is to test a whole use case scenario including all interface partners. With easy
    definition of test cases via XML the framework will simulate the message flow step by step and
    ensure the correct end-to-end processing.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="introduction-usage"></a>1.2.&nbsp;Usage scenarios</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>When should someone use the Citrus test framework? If you are in charge of an EAI application and need to test 
    its integration into the existing software landscape. In case your project interacts with a lot of other software systems and
    you need to simulate those in order to test your end-to-end processing. In case you need to increase the stability of an existing EAI 
    projects dealing with change requests, bugfixes or regression testing. Or if you simply need to increase your test coverage, in order to feel 
    comfortable regarding the next software release.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="preface.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="setup.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Preface&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Setup</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
