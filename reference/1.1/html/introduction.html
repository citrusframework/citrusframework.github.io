  interface partners over loosely coupled message-based communication. The interaction of
  several interface partners needs to be tested in integration testing.</p><p>In integration tests we need to simulate the communication over various transports. How can we 
  test use case scenarios that include several interface partners interacting with each other? How can 
  somebody ensure that the software component is working correctly with the other software systems.
  How can somebody run positive and negative integration test cases in an automated reproducible way? 
  Citrus tries to answer these questions offering automated integration testing of message-based software 
  components.</p><div class="section" title="1.1.&nbsp;Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="introduction-overview"></a>1.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>Citrus aims to strongly support you in simulating interface partners across different messaging transports. 
    You can easily subscribe and publish to a wide range of protocols like HTTP, JMS, TCP/IP and SOAP. 
    The framework can send and receive messages in order to create a communication chain that simulates a whole use case scenario. 
    In each communication step Citrus is able to validate message contents. In addition to that the framework offers a 
    wide range of actions to take control of the process flow during a test (e.g. iterations, 
    system availability checks, database validation, parallelism, delaying, error simulation, scripting, and many more).</p><p>The basic goal in Citrus test cases is to describe a whole use case scenario including several interface partners 
    that exchange messages with each other. You can set up complex message and data flows with several test steps as a pure XML file.
    The test description can be executed multiple times as automated integration test where Citrus simulated all surrounding 
    interface partners that are not present in the test environment. With easy definition of expected message contents via XML 
    Citrus is able to validate the data flow and the end-to-end use case processing.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.2.&nbsp;Usage scenarios"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="introduction-usage"></a>1.2.&nbsp;Usage scenarios</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are in charge of an enterprise application in a service-oriented Architecture with message interfaces to other software 
    components you should use Citrus. In case your project interacts with other software systems over different messaging transports and 
    you need to simulate your interface partners for extended end-to-end testing you should use Citrus. In case you need to increase the 
    software stability dealing with change requests, bugfixing or regression testing you should use Citrus. In case you simply want to 
    increase your test coverage with automated integration tests, in order to feel comfortable regarding the next software release you 
    should definitely use Citrus.</p><p>

    </p><p>This test set up is typical for Citrus use cases. In a such a test scenario we have a system under test (SUT) with several message 
    interfaces to other applications. A client application invokes services on the SUT application. The SUT is linked to several backend 
    applications over various messaging transports (here SOAP, JMS, and Http). Interim message notifications and final responses are sent back 
    to the client application. This generates a bunch of messages that are exchanged throughout the applications involved.</p><p>In the automated integration test Citrus needs to send and receive those messages over different transports. Citrus takes care of all 
    interface partners (ClientApplication, Backend1, Backend2, Backend3) and simulates their behavior by sending proper response messages in 
    order to keep the message flow alive.</p><p>Each communication step comes with message validation and XML tree comparison towards an expected message template. Besides 
    messaging actions Citrus is also able to perform plenty of other test actions. You could have a look at the database in order to check 
    the persistence layer for instance.</p><p>The Citrus test case runs fully automated as Java application. Step by step the whole use case scenario is performed like in a 
    real production environment. The Java test is repeatable and is included into the software building process (e.g. using Maven) like a 
    normal unit test case would do. This gives you the automated integration testing to ensure your interface stability to external partners.</p><p>The following reference guide walks through all Citrus functionalities and shows how to set up a great integration test with Citrus.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="preface.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="setup.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Preface&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Setup</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
